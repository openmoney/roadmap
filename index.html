<h1>openmoney development roadmap</h1>

<h4>Clarification of terms:</h4>

<p>The term <i>open money</i> (all lower case) refers to the concept of user-created "monies". This is described in a number of writings many of which have been collected <a href="https://openmoney.github.io/openmoney-links/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In this sense, <i>open money</i> is a particular case of <i>open metrics</i>.</p>

<p>The name <i>openmoney</i> refers to specific software used to implement <i>open money</i> or, more generally, <i>open metrics</i>.</p>

<h3>The current openmoney (OM) suite</h3>

<p>The <a href="current.html">current implementation</a> of the <i>openmoney</i> software is essentially a proof-of-concept prototype. However, it includes some important and valuable features that must be retained and expanded upon. </p>

<p>The <i>OM suite</i> described above is very much a work in progress, and is intended primarily as a proof-of-concept demonstration system. This version has been written for use only on Ubuntu (and possibly Debian) and runs Couchbase in a Docker container.</p>

<p>Although Couchbase scales well and can replicate very quickly if clustered, the user-centred design of the <i>OM suite</i> might make Holochain a more natural fit in due course.</p>

<h3>Immediate/shorter-term development</h3>

<ul>

<li>Completion, extension and clarification of the specification <a hre="https://openmoney.github.io/specification/">specification</a></li>

<li>Preparation of UML interpretation/condensation from verbose specification.</li>

<li>Preparation of OpenAPI 3.0 specification YAML file (informed in part by the existing Swagger 2.0 YAML definition).</li>

<li>Construction of reference implementation using Flask importing RNNSA Python package - see below).</li>

<li>Generation of API and client stubs from OpenAPI 3.0 specification.</li>

<li>Preparation of GraphQL interpretaion for Holochain Webassembly implementation.</li>

<li>Preparation of specification file to automate production of hApp code.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Medium-term development</h3>

<img src="dependencies_2_842x496.png" width="842" height="496" />

<br />

<ul>

<li>Complete OpenAPI-generated client libraries (Python and Rust initially).</li>

<li>Develop a richer collection of reference clients.</li>

<li>Design and develop simulation/modelling/visualization suite (ABS).</li>

</ul>

<h3>Longer-term development</h3>

<ul>

<li>Develop user feedback systems.</li>

<li>Add further OpenAPI-generated client libraries (JavaScript initially?).</li>

</ul>

<h3>Additional components for open metrics implementation</h3>

<p>Because the recursive namespace structure naturally mirrors the structure of a Unix-like filesystem, that is being used as the basis of an alternative implementation currently under development as a Python module (RNNSA). The purposes of that will be to provide a quicker route to development of<ul>
<li>a richer collection of OM clients</li>
<li>a more easily expanded reference implementation</li>
<li>a simulation and visualization suite</li>
<li>support for compound/vector currencies (information-retentive)</li>
<li>modelling, forecasting and algedonic tools </li>
</ul></p>

<p>Another objective here is to provide an API consistent with, but a superset of, that of the <i>openmoney</i> suite described above. This will simplify development of portable and re-usable components.</p>

<p>The recursively-nested, holonic structure of the OM suite reflects the structure of the Viable System Model, so a suite of tools will be developed over time to support its application.</p>
