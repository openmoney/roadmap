<h1>openmoney development roadmap</h1>

<h4>Clarification of terms:</h4>

<p>The term <i>open money</i> (all lower case) refers to the concept of user-created "monies". This is described in a number of writings many of which have been collected <a href="https://openmoney.github.io/openmoney-links/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In this sense, <i>open money</i> is a particular case of <i>open metrics</i>.</p>

<p>The name <i>openmoney</i> refers to specific software used to implement <i>open money</i> or, more generally, <i>open metrics</i>.</p>

<h3>The current openmoney (OM) suite</h3>

<p>The <a href="current.html">current implementation</a> of the <i>openmoney</i> software is essentially a proof-of-concept prototype.</p>

<h3>The current state of development</h3>

<p>The <i>OM suite</i> described above is very much a work in progress, and is intended primarily as a proof-of-concept demonstration system. This version has been written for use only on Ubuntu (and possibly Debian) and runs Couchbase in a Docker container.</p>

<p>Although Couchbase scales well and can replicate very quickly if clustered, the user-centred design of the <i>OM suite</i> might make Holochain a more natural fit in due course.</p>

<h3>Reviewing, updating and extending the specification</h3>

<p>An urgent task being undertaking at the time of writing is the review and clarification of the core <a href="https://openmoney.github.io/specification/">specification</a>, updating and extending where necessary.</p>

<h3>In parallel ...</h3>

<ul>

<li>completion, extension and clarification of the specification <a hre="https://openmoney.github.io/specification/">specification</a></li>

<li>preparation of OpenAPI 3.0 specification YAML file (extended from the existing Swagger 2.0 YAML definition)</li>

<li>generation of API and client stubs from OpenAPI 3.0 specification - including Rust API framework for Holochain backend</li>

<li>preparation of specification file to automate production of hApp code</li>

</ul>

<h3>Medium-term development</h3>

<img src="dependencies_1_622x496.png" width="622" height="496" /> 

<ul>

<li>develop user feedback systems</li>

<li>complete OpenAPI-generated client libraries (Python and JavaScript initially)</li>

<li>develop a richer collection of clients</li>

<li>design and develop simulation/modelling/visualization suite</li>

</ul>

<h3>Longer-term development</h3>

?

<h3>An alternative implementation</h3>

<p>Because the recursive namespace structure naturally mirrors the structure of a Unix-like filesystem, that is being used as the basis of an alternative implementation currently under development as a Python module (RNA). The purposes of that will be to provide a quicker route to development of<ul>
<li>a richer collection of OM clients</li>
<li>a more easily expanded reference implementation</li>
<li>a simulation and visualization suite</li>
<li>support for compound/vector currencies (information-retentive)</li>
<li>modelling, forecasting and algedonic tools </li>
</ul></p>

<p>Another objective here is to provide an API consistent with, but a superset of, that of the <i>openmoney</i> suite described above. This will simplify development of portable and re-usable components.</p>

<p>The recursively-nested, holonic structure of the OM suite reflects the structure of the Viable System Model, so a suite of tools will be developed over time to support its application.</p>
