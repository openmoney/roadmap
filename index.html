<h1>
  [openmoney | <em>open money</em> | <em>open metrics</em> ] development
  roadmap
</h1>

<h4>
  Clarification of terms:
</h4>

<p>
  The term <em>open money</em> (all lower case) refers to the concept of
  user-created "monies". This is described in a number of writings many of
  which have been collected
  <a href="https://openmoney.github.io/openmoney-links/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  In this sense, <em>open money</em> is a particular case of <em>open
  measures</em> (a.k.a.<em>open metrics</em>).
</p>

<p>
  The names <em>openmoney</em> or <em>OpenMoney</em> (no spaces) refer to
  specific software used to implement <em>open money</em> or, more generally,
  <em>open measures/metrics</em>.
</p>

<h3>
  The current openmoney (OM) suite
</h3>

<p>
  The <a href="current.html">current implementation</a> of the
  <em>openmoney</em> software is essentially a proof-of-concept prototype.
  However, it includes some important and valuable features that must be
  retained and expanded upon.
</p>

<p>
  The <em>OM suite</em> described above is very much a work in progress, and is
  intended primarily as a proof-of-concept demonstration system. This version
  has been written for use only on Ubuntu (and possibly Debian) and runs
  <em></em>Couchbase in a Docker container.
</p>

<p>
  Although Couchbase scales well and can replicate very quickly if clustered,
  the user-centred design of the <em>OM suite</em> might make a distributed
  hash-chain system (e.g. <em>Holochain</em> a more natural fit in due course.
</p>

<h3>
  Immediate/shorter-term development
</h3>

<ul>

  <li>
    Completion, extension and clarification of the specification
    <a href="https://openmoney.github.io/specification/">specification</a>
    (currently excessively verbose pending condensation).
  </li>

  <li>
    Preparation of UML interpretation/condensation from verbose specification.
  </li>

  <li>
    Preparation of OpenAPI 3.0 specification YAML file (informed in part by the
    existing Swagger 2.0 YAML definition).
  </li>

  <li>
    Construction of reference/test/prototype/experimentation/demonstration
    implementation <a href="https://nests.lrc.org.uk">NESTS</a>.
  </li>
<!--
  <li>
    Generation of API and client stubs from OpenAPI 3.0 specification.
  </li>

  <li>
    Preparation of GraphQL interpretaion for Holochain Webassembly
    implementation.
  </li>

  <li>
    Preparation of specification file to automate production of hApp code.
  </li>
-->
</ul>

<h3>Medium-term development</h3>
<!--
<img src="dependencies_6_982x821.png" width="982" height="821" />
-->

<!-- test 3 -->
<ul>

  <li>
    Complete OpenAPI-generated client libraries (Python and Rust initially).
  </li>

  <li>
    Develop a richer collection of reference clients.
  </li>

  <li>
    Design and develop simulation/modelling/visualization suite (ABS).
  </li>

  </ul>

<h3>Longer-term development</h3>

<ul>

  <li>
    Develop user feedback systems.
  </li>

  <li>
    Add further OpenAPI-generated client libraries (JavaScript initially?).
  </li>

</ul>
